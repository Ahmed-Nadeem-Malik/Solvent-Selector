# Solvent Selector

This is a flask CRUD web app that lets the user see different solvents using different reactions. Flask will make the web app, rdkit will make the molecular structure of the solvents, SQLite/SQLalchemy will store different reactions and solvents in a database, and HTML/CSS will be used for styling. I started this project as I recently finished learning about databases in my course and also saw an internship that piqued my interest in combining CS and chemistry into cheminformatics so I made a small web app as a small proof of concept just to see if I am capable of doing an internship as a first year.
## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)


Please let me know if you have any recommendations to make this better, I just want to improve as a programmer :)
